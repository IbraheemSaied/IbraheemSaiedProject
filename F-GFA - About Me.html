<p class = "demopara"><h3>Hello, my name is Ibraheem Saied. I am a Senior at Oakland Technical High School and a Young Professional associated with Genesys Works. For quite some time now, I was heavily invested in getting into the farming industry and became inspired to become a farmer. It felt like something I found interest in as I use to grow plants and food in my backyard. I then became narrowed down on this career that I ignored every other career that was introduced to me. Even though many think that farmers do hands on, dirty work, it is suprising to say that farmers actually are heavily involved with technology and data analytics which I absolutely loved about this career. I did not grow up with a family that owned a farm, so that made me an inspiring First-Generation Farmer. I did some research on farming, and I have found that, unfortunately, the career that I became invested in is an unreliable investment and destined to fail. I became disinterested in this career and immediately searched for another that fell in my interest, however this information inspired me to spread the message to lots of people that so they can spread the word about this career and how hard it is to succeed in it and so that there can be a possibility that the people can fix this problem. I empathy with those who had the dreams that I once had, and hopefully this system can change for both us and the people that wish to inspire to become First-Generation farmers in the future.  </h3></p>
